# ADIS Tutorial 8 - System Dev. - Prog. Tools

## Question 1

a. Maximizing cohesion  makes the instructions in the module jointly accomplish a single task. This makes the program more well structured. Minimizing coupling  reduces the degree of dependence between the modules. This prevents a bug in one module from infecting another module, and reduce the need to modify multiple functions to resolve one issue due to side-effects. Both of this leads to a more maintainable program.

b. Good design helps to make the program more readable, understandable, modifiable, reduce program complexity and increases program logic. (Direct copy pasta).

## Question 2

a. CASE tool is Computer aided software engineering tool. It is a software that improves the efficiency of analysts in developing and maintaining the system.

b. CASE tools makes it **easy to draw models**. Standard shapes are provided. CASE tools makes it **easy to store models**. This allows subsequent retrieval and amendment. Finally, CASE tools **makes it easy to update models**. They can be easily edited, updated, and reprinted.

c. 

1. Draw descriptive diagrams. Eg. DFD & ERD.
2. Producing and maintaining diagrams
3. Enforcing adherence to development standards.
4. Maintaining data dictionary.
5. EXTRA: Prototyping.
6. EXTRA: Generating Computer Codes.
