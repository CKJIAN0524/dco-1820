## Question 1

### a) Define the term system request

System request is a formal request for the services of the IS department.

### b) Based on the above case study, identify and explain TWO (2) sources of system request.

The first source of system request is directives from top management. Mr Sam is the owner of the business, and pass down a directive to Mr. Patrick to perform a preliminary investigation.

Another source of system request is users needs. This is because one of the reason behind the system request is due to the growing number of customers, which cause the old system to be insufficient to handle users needs.

### c) Explain preliminary investigation from the aspect of the purpose and expected outcome of conducting a preliminary investigation.

Preliminary investigation is neeed to gather information to determine if problems specified in the systems request warrant conducting subsequent phases of the SDLC. The expected outcome is a preliminary investigation report to the management for recommendations.

### d) Suggest ONE (1) suitable fact gathering technique that can be used by Mr. Patrick to gather business requirements from the owner of a car service centre. Justify your answers with TWO (2) reasons.

One suitable fact gathering technique is observation. Observation allows the observer to cross-check and verify the information given previously, to ensure that the new customer recording system, billing system and scheduling system can match the needs of the car service center.

### e) Discuss THREE (3) non-functional requirements for the proposed office systems

Storage requirements. The three systems implemented must be able to quickly retrieve previous information, process entered information and update them quickly to ensure the office can operates smoothly with minimal time wasted.
