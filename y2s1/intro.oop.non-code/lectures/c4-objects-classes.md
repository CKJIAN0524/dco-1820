# C4: Objects & Classes

## Objectives

- Describe **objects and classes**.
- Use **UML** graphical notations to model classes and objects.
- Declare a class and create an object from a class.

## Procedural Paradigm VS. Object-oriented Paradigm

| Procedural Paradigm            | Features               | Object-Oriented Paradigm               |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Loose coupling                 | Data & methods         | Coupled into objects                   |
| Focus on methods               | Software design        | Focus on objects                       |
| Require sending data to object | Data & Method handling | All data and operations within objects |

## OOP Concepts

- **Object**: 
  - Distinctly identifiable **entity**
  - **Instance** of class
  - Has **unique identity, state, and behaviors**
    - **State**: defines objects, contains data fields / properties
    - **Behavior**: defines what object does, defined by methods

## Exam tips

1. Remember `primitive data type` this word and `referenced data types` this word.
2. Why multiple different constructors
   1. Make it easier and more flexible in terms of constructing a data type for other programmers.
3. Remember `object reference`
4. Remember the `This` method
5. Remember `static`, if you have `static`, the variable is considered to be belong to the class rather than the object/instance.
6. Remember `objects` and `classes` and their definitions, always asked in final exam
7. Sometimes, exam will give you UML graphical notations and ask you to name the objects and classes, or the opposite way.
