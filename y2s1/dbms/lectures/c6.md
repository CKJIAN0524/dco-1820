# C6: Virtual Table

## Virtual Table

- Not an actual table
- No restrictions when inserting and updating

## View table

SINGLE VIEW = 1 tables 

or 

READING VIEW = view only

or

COMPLEX VIEW = view only, cannot use for update

From these VIEWS, we can create SUBVIEW

Q57 (No restriction)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW B5Manager AS {
	SELECT *
	FROM Staff
	WHERE Bno = 'B5';
}

SELECT * FROM B5Manager;

INSERT INTO B5Manager(Sno, FName, LName, Position,Se, Salary, Bno) VALUES('SS02', 'Raymond', 'Alvin', 'Technician', 'M', 2500.00, 'B2');
```

Q57 (Read only)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW B5Manager AS {
	SELECT *
	FROM Staff
	WHERE Bno = 'B5'
	WITH READ ONLY CONSTRAINT read_only;
}

SELECT * FROM B5Manager;

INSERT INTO B5Manager(Sno, FName, LName, Position,Se, Salary, Bno) VALUES('SS02', 'Raymond', 'Alvin', 'Technician', 'M', 2500.00, 'B2');
```

- Will cause error, ORA-43299, cannot perform DML operation on read-only view. Never come out in assignment

Q58

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW B5Staff AS
SELECT	Sno, FName, LName, Position, Tel_No
FROM	B5Manager;
```

Q59

```sql
DROP VIEW B5Staff;
```

Q60 (Don't just JOIN ON as much as possible, unless question ask)

```sql
/* Avoid this as much as possible */
SELECT 	R.Rno, FName, LName, Pno, VComment
FROM	Renter R, JOIN Viewing V ON R.Rno = V.Rno;
/* Natural join, use this */
SELECT 	R.Rno, FName, LName, Pno, VComment
FROM	Renter R, Viewing V
WHERE	R.Rno = V.Rno;
```

Q61

```sql
/* Avoid this as much as possible */
SELECT 		B.Bno, B.City, S.Sno, FName, LName, Pno
FROM 		Branch B JOIN Staff S ON B.Bno = S.Bno
			JOIN Property_For_Rent P ON S.Sno = P.Sno
ORDER BY 	B.Bno, S.Sno, Pno;

/* Natural join, use this */
SELECT 		B.Bno, B.City, S.Sno, FName, LName, Pno
FROM 		Branch B, Staff S, Property_For_Rent P
WHERE		B.Bno = S.Bno AND S.Sno = P.Sno
ORDER BY 	B.Bno, S.Sno, Pno;
```

Q62 (Recursive Query) - Exam never come out

```sql
SELECT	S.Sno, S.Fname, S.MGR_Sno, M.FName, M.LName
FROM	Staff S, Staff1 M,
WHERE	S.MRG=Sno = M.Sno
ORDER BY	S.MGR_Sno;
```

Q63 :star: HOT TOPIC 

- LEFT JOIN means focus on left table, and find joining on RIGHT table
- RIGHT JOIN means focus on right table, and find joining on LEFT table

- INNER JOIN means intersect/and in math.
- OUTER JOIN means union/or in math.
- FULL JOIN two add together.

**Right outer join**

```sql
SELECT	B.*, P.*
FROM	Branch1 B RIGHT OUTER JOIN Property_For_Rent1 P
		ON B.Bno = P.Bno;
```

Q65

```sql
SELECT	B.*, P.*
FROM	Branch1 B RIGHT FULL JOIN Property_For_Rent1 P
		ON B.Bno = P.Bno;
```

Set Operations

UNION: Remove duplicate

UNION ALL: Remain Duplicate

Q66

```sql
SELECT * FROM StaffA
UNION ALL
(SELECT * FROM StaffB);
```
