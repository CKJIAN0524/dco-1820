### C5

- LLC & MAC, read ALL
- Data encapsulation :star:
  - 3 primary Function, definition
- :star: Unicast address
  - Ask to guess address, unicast, multicast, or broadcast
  - Ask source **IP** & destination **IP** address
  - Ask source **frame** and destination **frame**, copy down MAC address (DONT WRITE IP)
  - What is this diagram, unicast, broadcast, or multicast.
    - If destination map is 1 device, then unicast
    - If destination map is all F, then broadcast
    - If destination IP start with 224, then multicast
- :star: IP address vs MAC address
- :star: :star: ARP Purpose, protocols, all ARP Process, refers to tutorial question.
  - (Tutorial) What happens when you have a frame when you cannot find the destination
  - Refer to your tutorial question Tutorial 5 (c)
    - If cant find destination, then IP will broadcast to all except incoming address
    - Sometimes PC will change (scenario will change)

### Not listed
